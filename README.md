# Project overview

This is the second project from the **JavaScript Basics** section of the [Odin Project Foundations Course](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations#javascript-basics).

The aim is to build a simple sketchpad in the browser.

A live preview is available [here](https://sabrunel.github.io/etch-a-sketch/).

**How to use it**

- Type in the desired canvas height/width between 2 and 100 and select CREATE (*default is 16x16*)
- Select a color option at the top (*default is BLACK*)
- Click anywhere in the white canvas to start drawing, then click again to stop
- Clear the canvas by selecting CLEAR

# What I learned

More DOM manipulation and tricks.

# What's next

I'd love to revisit this project and make it a simple pixel art tool, including a proper color picker and the possibility to save the canvas to a file.
